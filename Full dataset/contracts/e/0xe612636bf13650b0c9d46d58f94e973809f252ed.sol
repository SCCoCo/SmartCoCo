    ###### Purpose of contract ########
    This smart contract allows users to securely stake various tokens 
    representing their share in Invictus funds (c10 etc).

    Staking tokens for certain periods of time will entitle users
    to rewards (ICT tokens).

    ICT tokens to be bought off the open-market by Invictus with fund fees,
    to create value for token holders.
